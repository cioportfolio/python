# After your first steps with Python

At the [TechJams](https://techjam.softwarecornwall.org/) you can get started with the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programing language by working through some of our pre-prepared exercises. In these exercises you will have used things like [variables](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables.asp) and [functions](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp) [controls structures](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp) but you might not have realised what these can do. As you take on your own projects it will really help if you understand these things a little more so that you can use them yourself.

## Using a Python workspace

### Raspberry Pi

[Thonny](https://thonny.org/) is usually already installed and can be used for these exercises

### PC

You can install [Thonny](https://thonny.org/) on a PC or search for 'Python' in your PC's App Store

### Web

There are quite a few online Python editors available. You can search for one yourself or just try [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/)
